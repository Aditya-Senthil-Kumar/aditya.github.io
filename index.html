                <p>
                    Growing up in an environment where excellence in Computer Science, Biology, or Biotechnology was highly esteemed, 
                    I was drawn to the magic of technology—not just for its own sake, but for its potential to connect and transform. 
                    My fascination wasn't confined to the digital landscapes of gaming or the sleek designs of the latest mobile phones; 
                    it was the underlying mechanics, the software, the bits and bytes that held my unwavering attention. Pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at SRM Institute of Science & Technology, Chennai, India, was my first step towards demystifying these marvels. This path was not just about acquiring knowledge; it was about satisfying a deep curiosity about how technology shapes our world.

                <p>
                    After my graduation in May 2018, I ventured into the world of business analytics, spending three years as a Business Analyst. This experience was transformative, offering me a platform to apply my technical skills in Python, SQL, and automation tools like UiPath to real-world business challenges. It was here that I truly understood the impact of technology on business processes and decision-making. The drive to further bridge the gap between technical prowess and business acumen led me to pursue a Master of Business Analytics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, USA. As I embark on this new chapter, I am not just excited about building and shaping my career in this dynamic field; I am eager to explore greater horizons, to innovate, and to contribute to transformative projects that leave a lasting impact on industries and societies alike.

                <p>
                    <br>The Wrigley case study from Harvard Business School delves into the strategic decision by the Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company, the world's leading chewing gum manufacturer, to undergo a major recapitalization. Facing a declining share price despite strong financial health, the company considered issuing $3 billion in debt for a dividend payout or share repurchase. With a market value of $13.1 billion, no existing debt, and substantial family ownership, the case examines the potential financial impacts, including tax shield benefits, of leveraged recapitalization on Wrigley's value and shareholder returns. This analysis offers insights into the complexities of capital restructuring in enhancing company value.<br>

                    IMITATING HUMAN-LIKE DRIVING USING INVERSE RL IN WEBOTS
                </a>
                <p>
                    <br>Implemented a Maximum Entropy Deep Inverse RL approach on human-like demonstration data. The data was generated using
                    the vehicle ”Tesla Model 3” on Webots Robot simulator, driven around using keyboard controls.<br>
                    <br>A deep neural network with two hidden layers of dimension 3 was used to estimate the reward structure. The state space was
                    discretised and state visitation frequencies used as features to learn the weights for the network.<br>
                    <br>The obtained policy showed promising results by exhibiting driving behaviour which was very close to the human-demonstrator.<br>
